<h1>2022: The Moment</h1>
<h2>The Competition</h2>
<p>The Student Robotics theme for this year was This Way Up. The arena was filled with cans, some of which were the wrong way up and on the arena floor, and some of which were the right way up and on a plinth in the middle of the arena. The aim of the game was to collect cans and return them to your starting zone. You scored # points for cans the wrong way up and # points for cans the right way up. The cans were bare metal with a strip of insulating tape around the bottom.</p>
<h2>The Robot</h2>
<p>The robot was designed with a can catcher 'inverse snowplough' on the front of the robot, with a switch at its centre to detect when a can had been collected. Then the can was grabbed by some 3D-printed pincer arms, lifted and turned within the robot, and deposited onto a ramp at the back of the robot. The robot could hold a maximum of 3 cans. When it had collected them, it would reverse back to the starting zone, lift the 'gate' holding the cans in the robot and drive forwards, leaving the cans the right way up and in the start zone.</p>
